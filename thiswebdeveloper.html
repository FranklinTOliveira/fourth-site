    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>I want to build up my prospects so that in 10 years I can provide security for myself on a more independent basis.</p>

    <ol><p><li>Financial security.</p>
        <p>I want to be a freelancer. I will post websites for people, edit work and post analyses, not for mere code. Rather anyone who wants material online will be able to contract with me--to have their message placed on the Internet, their message properly pitched and their data evaluated and sorted out.</p></li>

        <p><li>Companionate security.</p>

        <p>I want to be connected into a network--people with common interests and common subjects to talk with, to be friends or perhaps even more. I want my network to provide business contacts, recreational opportunities, romance and supporters for my next moves at any given time.</p></li>

        <p><li>Romantic security.</p>

        <p>I want a girlfriend who is not weirded out by me. I want a girlfriend who is interested in many of the things I am interested in. I want a girlfriend who can be integrated into my network of friends and who can integrate me into her network of friends.</p></li>

    </ol>

    <h2>My Cause--Standing for the Truth</h2>

    <p>I think the way the world is, is not the way it should be. I would like to refine my expressive abilities over the course of the next 10 years so I can podcast, write or perhaps even YouTube on what&#39;s wrong. I want to express insight into what&#39;s missing and to express to the best of my analytical abilities, what the actual truth is.</p>

    <h1>Long-Term Plans</h1>

    <p>The gains and losses in life are cumulative in nature. I plan to take advantage of this to build the better life I hope to have in 10 years. I foresee a few constant themes.</p>

    <ol>

        <p><li>Organizing People.</p>

        <p>I believe that if I organize a small group of people can be the beginning of great things. If they meet, others can be drawn to the events I hold. This creates a larger group. As the group coalesces, it attracts like-minded people. Thus, a club forms, with formal and informal connections to network. From this, I acquire opportunities for friendship, romance, employment and other opportunities.</p></li>

        <p><li>Experience, Paid &amp; Unpaid.</p>

        <p>This ties into institutional networking. As I volunteer for organizations as well as build organizations myself, I gain job experience. With (unpaid) experience, I can acquire (paid) experience since the name of the game is: to get experience, I must have experience.</p></li>

        <p><li>Creativity.</p>

        <p>I have story ideas, job skill ideas, historical analysis ideas, etc., and I find, the older I get, that my ideas become deeper and more systemic but never to the point where gaps disappear. To fill gaps, I must get more ideas. This in turn makes my thought patterns deeper and more systematic.</p></li>

    </ol>
