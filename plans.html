<h1>Long-Term Plans</h1>

<p>The gains and losses in life are cumulative in nature. I plan to take advantage of this to build the better life I hope to have in 10 years. I foresee a few constant themes.</p>

<ol>
  
<p><li>Organizing People.</p>

<p>I believe that if I organize a small group of people can be the beginning of great things. If they meet, others can be drawn to the events I hold. This creates a larger group. As the group coalesces, it attracts like-minded people. Thus, a club forms, with formal and informal connections to network. From this, I acquire opportunities for friendship, romance, employment and other opportunities.</p></li>
	
<p><li>Experience, Paid &amp; Unpaid.</p>

<p>This ties into institutional networking. As I volunteer for organizations as well as build organizations myself, I gain job experience. With (unpaid) experience, I can acquire (paid) experience since the name of the game is: to get experience, I must have experience.</p></li>

<p><li>Creativity.</p>

<p>I have story ideas, job skill ideas, historical analysis ideas, etc., and I find, the older I get, that my ideas become deeper and more systemic but never to the point where gaps disappear. To fill gaps, I must get more ideas. This in turn makes my thought patterns deeper and more systematic.</p></li>		

</ol>
